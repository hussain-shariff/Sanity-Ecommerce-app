## Lessons Learned

This project is one of [frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io)'s GURU challenges. I have been taking up challenges on their platform for almost a year, since I started my coding journey, and I remember looking at this particular project, wondering when I will be skilled enough to execute it. Well! Now I know! ðŸ˜Ž

This project is by far one of the hardest projects I have ever executed. It was both challenging and full of learning/unlearning of new TypeScript, React & Next JS concepts.
